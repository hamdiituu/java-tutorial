/*
 *  Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
 *  And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter.
 *  In our example, we named the class Main.
 *  
 * Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
 * The name of the java file must match the class name. 
 * When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
 *
 * The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program.
 * 
 * You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
 * 
 * Text must be wrapped inside double quotations marks ""
